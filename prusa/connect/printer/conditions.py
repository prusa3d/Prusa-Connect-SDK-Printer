"""
A component to handle error conditions

Conditions are tree nodes, if a parent node becomes NOK,
all children become NOK too. If all children of a node become OK,
the parent node becomes OK

Use the tracker to get the most important error according to the tracked
condition priorities. This should make it easy to show the same error
independent of whether it's the LCD or the web.
